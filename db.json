		"Para1": "Karura Forest, a haven for nature lovers, is in the news after a jogger spotted an adult African Rock Python and shared a photo on social media.\n\nThe jogger spotted the nonvenomous reptile on Wednesday as it slithered near Junction 41 in the forest.\n\nThe photo sent shivers to many joggers who were concerned of their safety in the forest.\n\nProfessor Karanja Njoroge, the Chairman of Friends of Karura Forest, has warned patrons not to corner the snake when they see it, but to let it be and keep to designated tracks.\n\n\u201cThe snakes won\u2019t attack unless totally cornered. It is completely harmless to humans greater than 20kg in weight,\u201d said Prof Karanja.\n\nIn another Facebook post, Friends of Karura said there is no need for joggers or bikers to worry."
		"para2": "\n\n\u201cPythons are harmless to people, unless, as with most animals, they are cornered or severely provoked. They are not venomous at all and are shy that is why not one has been spotted in several years.\n\n\u201cPythons are solitary and typically stay near water. It is likely that this one has wandered up from the Ruaka River, looking for prey during this severe dry period, or perhaps to shed its skin,\u201d added the post.\n\nKarura Forest is located off Limuru Road and is managed by the Kenya Forest Service in conjunction with the Friends of Karura Forest Community Forest Association."
